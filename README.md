<p align="center">A simple demo for <a href="https://github.com/masakk1/lunamesh/tree/main">LunaMesh</a></p>

## Description
This is a demo for [LunaMesh](https://github.com/masakk1/lunamesh) showing how to use it.

> [!NOTE]
> There aren't any advanced techniques like *reconciliation*, *client prediction* or *lag compensation*.
> So entities will look jittery, and the player will always teleport to the absolute position of the server.
>
> Until I implement those features, Gabriel Gambetta has a very good [article](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) on this topic.
